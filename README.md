You need to set the username yourself in `app.js` - http://www.developers.meethue.com/documentation/configuration-api#71_create_user

The light ID used is `3`. Change that to the light you want to flash.

Extend and modify with the `node-hue-api` library used :) https://github.com/peter-murray/node-hue-api
